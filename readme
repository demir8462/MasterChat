Seems working good.
What is this , how does it work and whats is the privilege ?
This is a basic chatroom, communucation application which requires a server to create rooms. People can start a server , create rooms with passwords.
Eventhough so far everything seems normal , this application is plugin based and also opensource. I've published the code with a few events such as
getmessage and getpackage. For instance you can code a plugin that makes messages crypted before sent and set the plugin type as essential so people who don't 
have these plugins can not connect. Events and properties can be improved and increased.
